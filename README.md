# Troublesome Tanks
Prove that you're the most troublesome tank of all!

Play up to 4-player multiplayer on one computer and fight to the death in this thrilling global phenomenon!

Alternatively, play with up 3 other people online!

Totally not inspired by another particular video game of a similar name! That being Tank Trouble!

<h2> Before you play </h2>

This project is WIP. Very very WIP. Expect bugs and glitches.

The itch.io website previously used to host the game has been replaced with this website, and it will no longer be updated.
